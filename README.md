# Prouns Generator

The project was inspired by atrworks of [Russian suprematist El Lissitzky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Lissitzky) who introduced a large body of drawings between 1919 and 1927 named by the word 'Proun', an acronym for 'project of the affirmation of the new'. 

The generator produces random compositions out of rectangles. You are able to change the number of figures, opacity, to try different color schemes and to download the image.

Typescript, React.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
